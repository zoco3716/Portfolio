      <p>This was a straightforward project for a course where we were asked to create an informative 
        poster for an existing product.</p>
        <img src="portfolioAssets/Tombow MONO Poster.png" alt="screenshot of Google Drawings workspace" class="project-images">
      <p>At the time, my laptop froze and I couldn't use Photoshop, so I turned to Google Drawings 
        instead. While not a professional platform, it allowed me to focus on basic design and layout, 
        which were the most important aspects of the assignment.</p>
      <p>I used the masking tool on my iPhone to remove backgrounds from photos I took myself, and 
        did my best to make Google Drawings work. Given the tools and time I had, I’m proud of the final 
        result.</p>
      <p>You might notice a reference to Jeremy Allen White. Early in the semester, my group decided to 
        include him or one of his projects in every submission. It started as a joke but turned into a 
        creative challenge that pushed us to think more critically and make our work more engaging.</p>
