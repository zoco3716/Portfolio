        <h2 class="p">About Me</h2>
        <p class="p">I’m Zoe Cooper, a junior at CU Boulder majoring in Creative 
          Technology & Design—an engineering degree with a focus on design and human 
          interaction—and minoring in Engineering Management. I’m enthusiastic 
          about creating all kinds of art, especially writing music, designing concepts, and crafting. I 
          firmly believe that art is whatever you make it and that it holds a 
          meaningful place in the world. Through my work, I strive to highlight the 
          complexity and wonder of the world, encouraging others to engage with it 
          through creativity and shared knowledge.</p>
