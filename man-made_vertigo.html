    <div class="project-description">
      <p>This album is a passion project that started in 2023 when I set out to release it in 200 days, though it ended up taking much 
        longer. Having written songs for a while, I wanted to challenge myself to create a polished project for public streaming platforms. 
        The album blends singer/songwriter with elements of folk and pop. <b>I wrote, recorded, produced, and mixed every song,</b> allowing the 
        project to evolve like a traveling journal, documenting my emotions and experiences. Throughout the process, I have learned a lot 
        about songwriting, production, and mixing music for release. Now, a year and a half later, the album will soon be available on all 
        streaming platforms. </p>

      <img src="portfolioAssets/200 days TikTok.jpg" alt="Project Image 2" class="project-images"><br>
      <p class = "p1">#MakingAnAlbumIn200Days is my TikTok series documenting the process.</p>

      <p>When I came up with the idea for this project, I thought a lot about how important social media is for the success of any personal 
        project. I knew I would need to be active on social media if I wanted my album to reach a wider audience beyond just my close 
        friends.</p>
      <p>On December 11th of 2023, I started the series 'Making an Album in 200 Days' and began posting every few days about the progress of 
        the album. I shared details about the recording process, my songwriting journey, and short demos of some of the songs. Seeing 
        comments like “Gonna follow you to see you succeed :)” and random people wishing me luck was really encouraging from the start. As 
        the project went on, I ended up posting most about delaying the album and struggling with the timeline, which became the real 
        challenge.</p>
      <p>I originally projected the album to be released on June 28th of 2024, but after encountering several roadblocks, I had to push the 
        release back to April 2025. I learned that I am really dedicated to making my final piece as perfect as it can be. I’m proud to say 
        I’ve stuck to that commitment.</p>

      <img src="portfolioAssets/mmvCovers.jpg" alt="Project Image 3" class="project-images"><br>
      <p class = "p1">I spent hours working on drafts of the album cover, slowly determining the aesthetic.</p>

      <p>The aesthetic of the album and my artist branding are really important to me. I judge books by their covers, so I understand how 
        crucial it is to have an appealing brand, especially in today's social media-driven world where artists like Sabrina Carpenter have 
        defined their brand so strongly that it contributes to their success. I’ve always been drawn to a dark, sailing aesthetic, like an 
        old, sad man lost at sea with sirens, lighthouses, and albatrosses.</p>
      <p>Most of the songs on the album were written before I started the project. However, I wrote 'The Man in the Moon,' after I started, 
        which I chose as my artist name.</p>
      <p>I also enjoyed creating drafts for the album cover using watercolor, Polaroids, and photography. This process felt almost like a 
        separate project from the music itself. It was exciting to see a physical representation of the project as it evolved, watching the 
        songs and tracklist come together into something more concrete.</p>

      <img src="portfolioAssets/mmvTracklists.jpg" alt="Project Image 3" class="project-images"><br>
      <p class = "p1">There were many drafts of the tracklist. With so much time, I changed my mind a lot.</p>

      <p>I started the album project with an initial tracklist of songs I had already written, which formed a cohesive story I wanted to 
        tell. These songs were like chronological journal entries before, during, and immediately after my first real relationship.</p>
      <p>The feel of the songs shifted as my emotions did, so this layout made sense. However, during the TikTok 'challenge,' I worked 
        through more emotions and wrote additional songs that felt more important to include in the final album. As a result, I adapted the 
        tracklist to feature these more urgent songs and removed some of the ones I felt were less necessary.</p>

      <img src="portfolioAssets/logic-pro-10-8-mastering-assistant-custom-eq.png" alt="Logic Pro X's Built-in Mastering Assistant" class="project-images"><br>
      <p class = "p1">I used the mastering assistant built into Logic Pro X, where I recorded all my songs.</p>

      <p>The mastering process, which prepares a track for official release, has only recently begun as I’ve finalized some 
        recordings. I taught myself how to master through YouTube videos and articles, and it feels rewarding to officially seal up a 
        song, committing it to release. Currently, two out of the 14 tracks are mastered, with the rest to follow soon. I plan to 
        finalize all the songs by June of this year, with a release scheduled for June or July 2025. This project has been really fun 
        for me, and through it, I’ve learned a lot about my work ethic and determination.</p>
