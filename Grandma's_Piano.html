<h1>Grandma's Piano: A Miniature Replica</h1>

    <div class="project-description">
      <p>Grandma’s Piano: A Miniature Replica, was a deeply personal and rewarding experience where I 
        created a handmade toy piano modeled after the upright piano that had been in my family since the 1960s. Inspired 
        by my love for toy instruments that don't sound good and childhood memories, I wanted the piece to not only 
        function but also reflect the charm and sentimental value of the original. I worked mostly in my mom’s garage, 
        using her tools and enjoying the solitude to focus on building the wooden shell. </p>
        <p>Back in Boulder, I harvested parts 
        from a Melissa & Doug piano to make mine playable and spent time sanding, staining, and finishing it to match the 
        look of the family piano. There were definitely challenges, like workspace limitations, unfamiliar techniques, and 
        design elements I didn’t have time to finish, but I’m proud of how it turned out. I’ve been living with the piano 
        for a few weeks now and every time I walk by and play a little tune, I feel proud that I made something so 
        meaningful from start to finish. </p>

      <p class = "p1">#MakingAnAlbumIn200Days is my TikTok series documenting the process.</p>

      <p>When I came up with the idea for this project, I thought a lot about how important social media is for the success of any personal 
        project. I knew I would need to be active on social media if I wanted my album to reach a wider audience beyond just my close 
        friends.</p>
      <p>On December 11th of 2023, I started the series 'Making an Album in 200 Days' and began posting every few days about the progress of 
        the album. I shared details about the recording process, my songwriting journey, and short demos of some of the songs. Seeing 
        comments like “Gonna follow you to see you succeed :)” and random people wishing me luck was really encouraging from the start. As 
        the project went on, I ended up posting most about delaying the album and struggling with the timeline, which became the real 
        challenge.</p>
      <p>I originally projected the album to be released on June 28th of 2024, but after encountering several roadblocks, I had to push the 
        release back to April 2025. I learned that I am really dedicated to making my final piece as perfect as it can be. I’m proud to say 
        I’ve stuck to that commitment.</p>

      <p class = "p1">I spent hours working on drafts of the album cover, slowly determining the aesthetic.</p>

      <p>The aesthetic of the album and my artist branding are really important to me. I judge books by their covers, so I understand how 
        crucial it is to have an appealing brand, especially in today's social media-driven world where artists like Sabrina Carpenter have 
        defined their brand so strongly that it contributes to their success. I’ve always been drawn to a dark, sailing aesthetic, like an 
        old, sad man lost at sea with sirens, lighthouses, and albatrosses.</p>
      <p>Most of the songs on the album were written before I started the project. However, I wrote 'The Man in the Moon,' after I started, 
        which I chose as my artist name.</p>
      <p>I also enjoyed creating drafts for the album cover using watercolor, Polaroids, and photography. This process felt almost like a 
        separate project from the music itself. It was exciting to see a physical representation of the project as it evolved, watching the 
        songs and tracklist come together into something more concrete.</p>
